As a type 1 diabetic, I carry around an insulin pump. This device has dramatically improved my quality of life and that is what I wish to discuss.

The device does two primary functions.
1. Provide insulin delivery either time based or by continiously checking blood sugar and adjusting insulin delivery every interval.
2. Monitor blood sugar levels and use measurements as a feedback loop for insulin adjustment.
